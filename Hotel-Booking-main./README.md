# Hotel Booking Analysis Project

Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of hotel booking data sourced from Kaggle to gain insights into customer preferences, booking patterns, and room reservations. By utilizing Excel and its powerful pivot table features, the data has been transformed into graphical representations for a more intuitive understanding.
