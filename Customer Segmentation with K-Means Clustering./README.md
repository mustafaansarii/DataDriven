# Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

## Aim
The aim of this project is to apply K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their purchase behavior.

## Description
This project involves the utilization of the K-Means clustering algorithm to segment customers according to their purchasing behavior. By analyzing customer data, we aim to identify distinct segments or clusters that represent different types of customers. This segmentation can help businesses better understand their customer base, tailor marketing strategies, and optimize product offerings.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Mall Customers" dataset, which contains information about customers including their age, gender, annual income, and spending score.

## Methods
1. **Data Loading and Exploration:** The dataset is loaded using pandas and explored to understand its structure and characteristics.
2. **Data Visualization:** Various visualizations such as count plots, pair plots, histograms, and bar plots are used to gain insights into the distribution of data and relationships between different features.
3. **K-Means Clustering:** The K-Means clustering algorithm is applied to segment customers into clusters based on their features. The optimal number of clusters is determined using silhouette scores.
4. **Results Visualization:** The results of the clustering are visualized using scatter plots and box plots to understand the characteristics of each cluster and how they differ from each other.
5. **3D Visualization:** A 3D scatter plot is created to visualize the clusters in a three-dimensional space, providing a more comprehensive view of the segmentation.

## Conclusion
Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering provides valuable insights into the characteristics and behaviors of different customer segments. By understanding these segments, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies and product offerings to better meet the needs of their customers.
