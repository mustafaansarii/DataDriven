# Titanic Dataset Analysis

This project involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The dataset provides information about passengers on the Titanic, including details like survival status, passenger class, age, and more.

## Overview

The primary objectives of this project are:

- Perform data cleaning to handle missing values and outliers.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains the following columns:

- PassengerId
- Survived
- Pclass
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- SibSp
- Parch
- Ticket
- Fare
- Cabin
- Embarked

## Exploratory Data Analysis

### 1. Data Cleaning


- Handle missing values and outliers.
- Drop unnecessary columns or rows.

  
### 2. Descriptive Statistics

- Display summary statistics of the dataset.



### 3. Visualizations

- Create visualizations to explore relationships between variables.
- Include histograms, boxplots, countplots, and pairplots.
